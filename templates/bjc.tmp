<p><a target="_blank" href="https://bjc.berkeley.edu"><strong>The Beauty and Joy of Computing (BJC)</strong></a> is an introductory computer science curriculum developed at the University of California, Berkeley, intended for non-CS majors at the high school junior through undergraduate freshman level. It was one of the five initial pilot programs for the <a href="http://csprinciples.org">AP CS Principles</a> course being developed by the College Board and the National Science Foundation. We offer it as <a href="http://cs10.org/">CS10</a> at Berkeley.</p>
