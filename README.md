# Snap Social Platform

The social website for the Snap! programming language/environment

## Build System

This site is powered by a super simple home-brewed page descriptor system I named **Snippets**. Check it out at [https://github.com/bromagosa/Snippets](https://github.com/bromagosa/Snippets).

To build the site, do:

```
$ Snippets/build.sh
```

You can also start a webserver with `-s`, and watch changes for a live-reload experience with `-w`:

```
$ Snippets/build.sh -w -s
```
